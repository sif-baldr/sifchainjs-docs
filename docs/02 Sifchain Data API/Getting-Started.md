# Getting Started

The Data API is a group of endpoints separate from the Sifnode API/RPC endpoints that utilized data stored in a centralized databased generated from on chain events within the Sifchain Network. This provides an alternative data source to the Sifnode chain data which allows for more performant data access for use on the DEX, for analytics, reporting and also by our third party partners.

This API can be accessed from the following data source https://data.sifchain.finance.
