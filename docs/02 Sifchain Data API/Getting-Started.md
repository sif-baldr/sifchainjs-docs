# Getting Started

The Data API is a group of endpoints separate from the Sifnode API endpoints generated from events created from the Sifchain Network and stored in a centralized database operated by the Data Pipeline team. This provides an alternative data source to the Sifnode chain data which allows for more performant data access for use on the DEX, analytics, reporting and also by our third party partners.
