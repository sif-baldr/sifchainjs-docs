# Sifchain - Extract Transform Load (ETL)

Deploy your own ETL server that extracts, transforms and loads sifchain data for analytics and application developments using your own database and sif-api instance. The repository is located at: https://github.com/Sifchain/sif-etl.

## Structure
This repository is shaped as follows:

- **/src/manager.py** is the commands manager, any command described in this file can be called using python3 ./src/manager.py <COMMAND> (replace <COMMAND> by the command name to run).
- **/src/commands** contains all the commands used by the manager
- **/src/events** contains all the event processors used by the event listener
- **/src/mutations** contains all mutations functions that update the database
- **/src/queries** contains all the queries functions to retrieve data from the database
- **/src/resolvers** contains components of the commands functions called resolvers
- **/src/utils** contains all utils functions used across the repository


## Installation
1. Install python 3
2. Install the other tools:
```json
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-virtualenv
```

3. Setup a virtual environment using virtualenv:
```json
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
```

4. Install the requirement packages:
```json
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Copy the dot env file and edit the new dot env file to fill up the required credentials:
```json
cp -a .env-example .env
```


## Get Started
You can now run an ETL command using the command manager with the following command line:

```json
python3 ./src/manager.py <COMMAND>
```

The list of command are provided in the next section.

## ETL Commands
Here are all the commands that you can run using the command manager:

- **tokenregistry**: retrieve latest changes in the on-chain token registry module and store to database.
- **external_price**: retrieve latest prices of all the available symbols and store to database
- **add_price_record**: retrieve latest pools data and compute symbol prices against rowan using the pools balances and store to database
- **add_price_record_pmtp**: retrieve latest pools swap prices and store to database
- **add_price_record_continuous**: run the command add_price_record continuously
- **refresh_pricespikes**: compute and store price spikes for rowan to database
- **update_once_day**: compute the highest daily block hight value and store to database
- **add_pool_record_continuous**: retrieve pools data and store to database
- **event_record_continuous**: retrieve latest blocks and parse and store all the events to database

## Database
The ETL server uses a timescale postgresql database with the tables defined in the schema file here.
