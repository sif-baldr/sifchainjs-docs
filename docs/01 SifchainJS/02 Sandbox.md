# Sandbox

Weâ€™ve put together a very basic Sandbox solution along with a sample app that will allow you to play around with the SifchainJS packages. The sandbox can be accessed here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sifchain-pools-demo?file=index.tsx.

You can edit the files as you see fit and play around with the demo. You can also create a fork of the demo and make changes which can be saved within your own repository.
